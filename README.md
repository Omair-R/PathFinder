# PathFinder
PathFinder is a simple maze solving demo program made in pygame. This is a very old program I made when I first learned Python. I am no longer interested in expanding it, but it's still a fun little time capsule.

## How can you use it?
It's quite simple, if you have numpy and pygame, all you have to do is run the main.py file:

```
python main.py
```
## What can it do?
- You can draw your own maze.

- Automatically generate solvable mazes.
